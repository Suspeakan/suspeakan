<br>
<p>Syllable Structure: (C)(C)(C)(V)(C)(C)(C), in a cluster of three, one of them must be a plosive, and a plosive that would not form a affricate with another fricative, so no /tʂt͡ʂ.../ but instead /<b>d</b>ʂt͡ʂ.../ <br> Affricates count as one phoneme, not their constituent plosive and fricative. <br> E.g., Dszczaszkł /dʂt͡ʂaʂkw/</p>
<br>
<p>Syllable initial /j/ will not not trigger palatalization in following consonants, if in a cluster (or on it's own), but will raise the nucleus slightly; if the nucleus is /i/ it becomes, already is, or can be assumed to be, lengthened (jéve /ˈji:.ve/). Any consonant, especially plosives, with /j/ after it, can be analyzed as being palatalized (Vodjo ˈfod.jo - ˈfodʲə).</p>
<br>
<p>A nucleus before an onset /j/ becomes lengthened, unless it is /i/, e.g. Kdajszto /ˈkdaː.jʂto/. Pairs of voiced plosives (like /bd/ or /dg/ are permitted)</p>
<br>
<p>Consonant clusters which differ in voice between the component parts, may be analyzed either as historical or all-voiced, to use the previous example: Kdajszto /ˈkdaː.jʂto/ (historical and writing-corresponding transliteration), can be analyzed as [ˈgdaː.jʂto] (more likely, actual pronounciation) (/j/ is the exception as it may be (a) semi-nuclear (partly a nucleus in of itself) or (b) be unvoiced when followed by an unvoiced consonant). Typically, the word final cluster tends to not assimilate, only the other clusters elsewhere in a word and syllables do this.</p>
<br>
<p>In certain contexts, nucelei preceding nasal consonants /m/ and /n/ may become nasalized. For example, <i>ama</i> /a.ma/ could be pronounced as [ˈã.ˌma] and <i>àni</i> /eni/ as [ˈẽ.ˌnɨ], with the following nucleus becoming stressed (this prevents palatalization of the nasal consonants) (and this is written with the secondary stress marker, but is more or less equal in stress to the original stressed syllable). This change is not realized in writing.</p>
<br>
<p>/i/ as nucleus, when /n/ or /m/ is in the onset position, is centralized to become [ɨ]</p>
<br>
<p>
  Generally, in the analysis of syllables, specifically the boundary between two syllables, if there is a single consonant (VCV), it goes to the latter, usually unstressed syllable [bold for stressed ->] (...<b>V</b>.CV...). If there is two (...VCCV...), generally, the two go to be a cluster on the unstressed syllable (...<b>V</b>.CCV... like in /ˈja.ʂdo/), if the two syllables are unstressed, they go evenly, one to each (...VC.CV), to distinguish this more, often a glottal stop is injected (...VCʔ.CV). For three (VCCCV), stressed syllables get one, unstressed vary on which syllable gets more, it depends on the word/compound. For anything above that, it's either irregular, or follows the pattern of stressed syllables getting the smaller part, and the latter unstressed getting the larger part.

These six words mean: "Our feet on the ground", and is a decent sentence for the first lesson in <i>Crifuzn /ˈt͡sri.fuʐn/</i>'s morphology, how it turns words into sentences and meaninful utterances, &c. If we disect it via <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php">interlinear glossing</a> (this website will not follow the rules entirely, this link is primarily to show newcomers how interl. glossing works), it will help reveal a few patterns and morphological devices used in Crifuzn.</p>
<code class="code"><gls>
  bjegie-die     jan-y         {a  sz-dov}-żah     \

  <br><br>
  <p>( [S[N-LOCP[bjegie] ["LOCP[a]"["LOC[a]" "-die"->2]["LOCP[b]"["jany a szdov"]]["LOC[b]" "-żah"]]]] )</p>
<p>The location, marked with "-die", the <i>ground</i>, where <i>our feet</i> are located/on, comes before <i>our feet</i>, while a clitic, "-żah", flanks <i>our feet</i> on the right. The order could be summed up as: "Where-What-Clitic". As in the diagram above, the clitic, "-żah", governs everything between "-die" and it, meaning everything between "-die" and "-żah" is the phrase for <i>what</i> is located (LOCP[b]), or the dependent phrase, in the head of the "Nominal-Locative" phrase (N-LOCP).</p>
<br>
<p>A later example shows how pronouns integrate with this: "Vcaszjavd gar..."lmnbgvhjhgfdfghj</p>
<br>
</div>
<p><i>Bjegiedie jany a szdovżah</i> demonstrates the theme of head-initiality. For example, with adjectives: <i>Vof kant <b>kroczip</b></i>, 'My red shirt', 'red' being <i>roczip</i> (here it agrees with <i>kant</i>, by prefixing it's initial consonant <i>k</i> and, since it doesn't end in a vowel, there is no suffixed vowel, like in zila z<i><b>roczip</b></i>a); here the head, <i>Vof kant</i> is modified by it's dependent <i>roczip</i>, which agrees with it.</p>
<br>

<div class="centered-text"><b>ADJECTIVES</b></div>
<br>

<p>Like with "zila zroczipa", the first consonant of the noun, if there is one, is prefixed, and if it ends in a vowel then that vowel is suffixed to match. But this doesn't always occur, if it would create a cluster of more than three consonants it is forbidden, if the adjective already ends in an vowel, no vowel needs to be suffixed and it doesn't <b>have to</b> change to match, it can, but it is perfectly fine not to; the prefixing does follow the rules of voice assimilation. Some prefixes cannot be added, (a) because of the aformentioned constraint on syllable structure; (b) approximants, /j/, /w/, /l/, and trill /r/ are forbidden from being prefixed (for example: "jadsłid czezuvd", <i>"(a) whole dog"</i>, <b>not</b> "jadsłid <b>j</b>czezuvd"); see the next paragraph for the third rule.</p>
<br>
<p>Take, "sovp slir", meaining "tall woman", it would not be pronounced fluidly, native speakers would trip over their speech if not for that the agreement prefixes have a glottal stop. "..vp sl.." is four consonants, not allowed, so it is more like /sovp sʔ lir/, this holds for prefixes that wouldn't violate the phonotactics, like the previously used "zila zroczipa" (/ˈzi.la zʔ ˈro.ʈ͡ʂip/). (c) In this scenario, if the only distinction between the two consonants in contact between syllables (in the "sovp slir" example, that would be /p/ and /s/) are only distinguished by voice, and are the same place and manner of articulation, the prefix is forbidden ("vajv pteg" (which will be seen later), would be the same, instead of "vajv fpteg"); (d) In the event of rule (c), if the in-contact consonants include a affricate, like "dzax<b>t d</b><i>z</i>dajżuk", only the first component is removed, and this is indicated in spelling: dzaxt zdajżuk.</p>

<p>The pronouns [In Crifuzn] are number-ambiguous, meaning whether <i>szi</i>/<i>v-</i> means "I" or "We" is determined in context, but there is a way to make pronouns plural, but it is not required; it only works with self-standing pronouns (which are not the prefixes). It is simple, like with nouns, prefix <i>a sz-</i>. <i>A szszi</i> ("We"); and as you can see, the prefix will remain even on the first person pronoun, causing the /ʂ/ to be pronounced twice, or geminated (lengthened: /ʂ:/). This is forbidden to occur with pronominal prefixes that are attached to verbs, more on that <i>after</i> the table below.</p>

<p>(Genitive pronouns in <a href="#section2">§2</a>)</p>
<p>Personal pronouns have four forms that they can be in, Nominative and self-standing (<b>NSsP</b>), Nominative and prefixal (<b>NPreP</b>), Oblqiue (<b>OblP</b>), and Special Oblique (<b>SOblP</b>) (Note, NSsP and OblP are both "self-standing" meaning they can be pluralized like was previously mentioned). Take the following sentence as an example:</p>
<br>
<p class="centered-text" style="font-size: larger;"><i>"<b>V</b>kana na <b>szi</b> tilina<b>l</b>."</i><br>"I know (that) I'm talking to you."</p>
<br>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">(1) NSsP are <i>agent</i> pronouns, taking the role of "actor"/"performer" of the main verb (and its phrase...) <b>and</b> is inside a subclause<b>¹</b>—these are the forms, <i>szi</i>, <i>ġu</i>, and <i>som</i>; which correspond to the NPreP to the right. The only NSsP in the above example, is <i>szi</i>.
      </div>
      <div class="column">(2) NPreP are, like NSsP, <i>agent</i> pronouns, but are inside the surclause; they are prefixed to the <i>main</i> verb therein—these are the prefixes: <i>v(o)-</i>, <i>ġa-</i>, and <i>s(o)-</i> which correspond to the NSsP listed to the left.
      The only NPreP in the above example is the prefix <i>V-</i>.</div>

      <div class="column">(3) OblP are <i>oblique</i> pronouns, taking any role except the <i>agent</i>, it could be the recipient of the action, or the tool with which the action is carried out, etc. They are the same no matter what type of clause they are in. They are: <i>szos</i>, <i>la</i>, and <i>łba</i>. The only OblP in the above example would be <i>la</i>, but see the paragraph about SOblP for the reason why it isn't...</div>
      <div class="column">(4) SOblP are the OblP but in certain contexts, a sort of "irregular" form of the OblP. In the above example, instead of <i>"...tilina la"</i> the <i>-a</i> of <i>la</i> is dropped and the <i>l</i> is suffixed, this most commonly happens to <i>la</i>, the others are much more unpredictable. This phenomenon (or lack thereof) is often employed in poetry. The prefixing follows phonotactic rules just as in adjective agreement! So in the event of an "illegal" prefixing, the normal OblP is used instead.</div>

  <p>
    <i>na</i> links the surclause to the subclause, making the subclause the object of the surclause, <i>he/she/they see me</i> becomes the object, it becomes that which <i>I know</i>. This relation of clause-dependancy is called a "noun clause", where the dependent clause is the subject or object of the independent clause. There are two other types that will be expounded in this section.
  </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  <p>Another type is an adverbial clause, this type of subclause functions as an adverb, providing information about the time, place, manner, reason, or condition—for example: "Because it's raining, we're staying indoors", which is:</p>
  <br>
  <p class="centered-text" style="font-size: larger;"> "Vcaszjavadżah gardie na tumła résza mvajan"<br><i>"We are indoors because it is raining outside."</i></p>
<code class="code" style="font-size: medium;"><gls>
V-  caszjav-a   -d -żah  gar   -die  na   tumła   rész-a    mvaj    -an
1SG-be     -IMPF-PL-LOCa house -LOCb CONJ because rain-IMPF outside -ADV
</gls></code>
<br>
<p>See <a href="#section2">§2</a> for the locative...</p>
<br>
<p>This is done very simply, using <i>na</i> plus an approapriate adverb—which, in this case, is <i>tumła</i>, "because".</p>
<!-- D: ADD LOCATIVE SECTION FOR HERE!! -->
<br>
<p>
  The third type of subclause is an adjectival, or <i>relative</i>, clause. These clauses act as adjectives, modifying a noun or pronoun (they do not follow adjective agreement like in <a href="#section2">§2</a>, but are post-positional; they are before adverbs when there is a NPreP).
</p>
<br>
<p class="centered-text" style="font-size: larger;">
  "Neczfie tok szi kaszéa ilian..."<br>"(The) Person (that) I meet every day..."
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Relativization is done using the particle: <i>tok</i>, which takes the relative clause after it, and therewith modifies the noun that comes before it.
