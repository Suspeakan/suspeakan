# My Top Albums

This list will be unordered, as trying to chose between masterpieces proves to, in most cases, just be a waste of time. So, there is no "best", but an "among the best"/"one of the best". Albums will be presented with the album name first, in italics, and then the artist or band afterwords. "[LIVE\]" will be used to denote a live album.
## The List

* _Every Red Heart Shines Towards the Red Sun_ — Red Sparrows
* _At the Soundless Dawn_ — Red Sparrows
* _98.12.28 男達の別れ (98.12.28 Otokotachi no Wakare)_ [LIVE\] — Fishmans
