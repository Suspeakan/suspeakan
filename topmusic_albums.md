# My Top Albums

This list will be unordered, as trying to chose between masterpieces proves to, in most cases, just be a waste of time. So, there is no "best", but an "among the best"/"one of the best". Albums will be presented with the album name first, in italics, and then the artist or band afterwords. "[LIVE\]" will be used to denote a live album. For most of the albums, I have listened to them a lot, but some less so; and may have significant low points that causes them not to have a 5/5 rating on RYM, such as _Piano Man_ by **Billy Joel**, half the tracks are phenomal, and the rest I care little for, but it still deserves to go on here. Some albums have emotional significance or a track I have listened to a lot, like _Loveless_ (**My Bloody Valentie**) (occasionally very powerful emotional connection, yet still very good, so it gets on the list) and _The Beggar_ (**Swans**) (because of the track _Ebbing_, my most listened to track).
