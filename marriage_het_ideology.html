<p class="maintext-western">“It establishes heteronormative
socioeconomic structures that are used by the bourgeoisie to
<u>indoctrinate the proletariat into having certain value systems</u>
that uphold their oppressive regime.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">By controlling and, consequently,
defining what constitutes the institution of marriage, the
bourgeoisie can fine tune the psyche of the proletarian population in
a way that is advantageous to their capitalistic ways.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">An example is how <span style="text-decoration: none"><u>it
has historically been used as means to define gender roles in a way
that relegated women to the household</u></span> so they can instead
produce more future laborers that will be used to reap further
surplus value. This upholds <u>the patriarchal nature of the power
structure</u>. This is also the same reason the state is so invested
(literally) in what women choose to do with regards to their
reproductive rights.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">By not allowing homosexual couples to get
married, you are penalizing them for choosing a lifestyle that
deviates from the heteronormative power structure since they aren’t
able to procreate and contribute to the bourgeoisie’s labor
exploitation pool.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">By not allowing interracial marriage, the
white supremacist power structure is upheld by keeping the “white
race” pure and thereby maintaining the white population as the
majority.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">Another thing worth thinking about is
that you typically need a house to raise a family, so <u>marriage
maintains the predatory housing market</u>.”</p>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">“Also, here is a very well written
quote about queer theory and it’s relation to the institution of
marriage:</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">“The more recent movement to gain the
legal right to same-sex marriage demonstrates some of the salient
differences between a lesbian/gay rights approach and a queer
activist strategy. While advocates for same- sex marriage argue that
lesbians and gay men should not be excluded from the privileges of
marriage accorded to straight couples, <u>many queer activists and
theorists question why marriage and the nuclear family should be the
sites of legal and social privilege in the first place</u>. Because
same-sex marriage would leave intact a structure that disadvantages
those who either cannot or choose not to marry (regardless of their
sexual orientation), a more ethical project, queer activists argue,
would seek to <u>detach material and social privileges from the
institution of marriage altogether</u>.”</p>

Are there materialistic reasons that lead to Patriarchy?</p>
<p class="maintext-western">“The hunter to animal domestication
pipeline was the main factor.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">Pre-agricultural revolution, there was a
division of labor where women did most of the wild food picking
(which accounted for most of the food actually), and the men did the
animal hunting, mainly because the hunting took them farther from
home, and in a matrilineal society, women lived with their mothers
and stayed close to home.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">As things transitioned out of clan to
agricultural society, and with the rise of animal domestication, men
became the ones to hold and control animal capital, switching to this
from their previous role as hunters. Animal capital then leads to
land capital (for grazing lands, then to entrench agricultural
production), then you get patriarchy, fiefdoms, feudalism, etc.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">/u/MajorMuttonChops also suggested
watching Paul Cockshott's - Rise of Class and Patriarchy, which is a
wonderful video, because he mentions other prerequisites, such as war
and religion.”</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">/</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">“Patriarchy is a family structure where
men are the dominant head of the family and women are submissive to
them. This basis of this is the idea that men are superior to women.
People think that if you get rid of this idea, you can get rid of
patriarchy. But this is not the case, it's not that this idea exists
that's why patriarchy exists, it's because patriarchy exists that
observing it makes people get the idea that men are superior to
women.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">To elaborate on it, patriarchy isn't an
idea but an objective reality manifested through relations of
production. The division of labour exists in the capitalist society
in a way that puts women in a position of dependency on the men for
their survival. This is effectively done by creating a class of
unpaid labour, that is, the work of raising children, cooking,
maintaining the home etc. Now this existing relation, when observed,
gives rise to the idea that women are submissive in nature and the
man is dominant and superior.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">So basically, patriarchy is a material
condition not an idea.”</p>
<p class="main-western"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/othmi8/on_queer_marxismmarxist_queer_theory/">//</a>
On Queer Marxism/Marxist Queer Theory?</p>
<p class="maintext-western">“I've said it before, I'll say it
again. There is very little useful literature on the topic. Marxists
can't even figure out the basics of women's oppression under
capitalism. Our line on women's oppression will severely impact how
we understand queer oppression and liberation.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">Many understand women's oppression to be
mainly situated within the family unit. They go on to argue that the
family is a construct of capitalism, whereby women's domestic labor
is necessary for the reproduction of male labor power. Frankly, I
think a lot of this is a stale or crude stereotype. First, it has
been criticized by third world women theorists on the basis that this
is only reflective of a certain class of women, namely white, middle
class women in europe and north america. Second, some have pointed
out that capital is by itself indifferent to the method of
reproduction of labor power, so long as labor power is reproduced.
Certainly capital does not care whether domestic labor falls mainly
on the woman in the relationship, or whether it is distributed
equally. Third, women actually make up the majority of the
proletariat in most local settings, and certainly internationally,
with some notable exceptions. This is especially important because it
breaks down the myth of women in the home and men in the factory.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">Taking the above line for granted, people
have argued that queer people experience oppression because queer
lifestyles necessarily push back on the family structure, challenging
the hetero-normativity required for the reproduction of the family.
Capital (allegedly) depends on the family unit for the reproduction
of labor-power. But let us not forget that assimilationist trends
within the queer movement seek to affirm the equal validity of the
queer family...</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">It's very easy to criticize stale,
dogmatic lines, and much harder to put forth something new and
positive. To date, a comprehensive, compelling account of queer
oppression has not been produced. A lot more work needs to be done in
this field, and too often Marxists are too quick to pick up the
stale, dogmatic line, because it is easy, and because they want to
appear &quot;progressive.&quot;</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">Some brief remarks, an early attempt at a
positive account:</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">(1) Gender oppression does not arise
spontaneously out of the capitalist mode of production, but from the
feudal mode of production. Capitalism continues to bear the
birthmarks of feudal society, and reproduces feudal superstructure
through its economic base. This includes the division of labor in the
family, as well as the division of labor through industry, where in
many industries, women represent the large majority of the work
force. Capital does depend on labor stratification, but that this
stratification takes on a gendered dimension is a product of history
and not of the inherent logic of capital. The gendered character of
labor stratification is nonetheless significant and must be
considered, when organizing masses of proletarian women, addressing
their unique concerns as proletarians and as women.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">(2) Women's oppression, in the capitalist
context, is not perpetuated by the old feudal base, and has a certain
anachronistic character. While bourgeois equality is not yet
realized, considerable gains have been made in the advanced
capitalist countries regarding the bourgeois democratic rights of
women (this does not apply to much of the world, which remains
semi-feudal and thus has not abolished the basic feudal oppression of
women).</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">(3) Queer oppression parallels women's
oppression, and the queer movement has always been split between
petty bourgeois reformism and assimilation (the struggle for
bourgeois democratic equality), versus lumpen/proletarian militancy,
recognizing that even gender as a superstructure has impacted their
material existence, relegating many queers to the margins of society,
outside of formal economy (this is true for those who were &quot;out,&quot;
at least). Let us consider the concept of &quot;gender outlaw&quot;
brought to us by Alyx Mayer, thinking about the material and economic
effects of queer marginalization.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">(4) Bourgeois democratic right has
impacted the nature of queer oppression. In the advanced capitalist
countries, with a bloated petty bourgeoisie, it has proven that
bourgeois democratic right is adequate for queer people to be free.
Right now, continued lumpen resistance to this line is marginal, even
as the facade of militarism is becoming more popular among &quot;radical&quot;
petty bourgeois queers.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">(5) Seeing through the facade of
radicalism requires a more sophisticated critique of the ideological
basis for reformism. The petty bourgeoisie has primarily relied upon
what I'm calling gender pathology to defend its bourgeois democratic
struggle. In its first iterations, we see the &quot;born this way&quot;
line, reducing the queer experience to a psychological, even
neurological phenomenon. We see this across the &quot;LGBT umbrella,&quot;
not just naturalizing sexual orientation, but naturalizing gender
identity. So much for gender as a social construct! Gender identity
is, for the gender pathologists, innate in the mind. Dealing
specifically with the question of trans and non-binary, our gender
pathologists act as though some people are &quot;innately&quot; men
and women, and other people non-binary.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">(6) This naturalization is dangerous,
first, because it precludes the possibility for overcoming gender and
gender oppression. It forces us to accept gender as a construct, it
is innate in the mind and cannot be overcome. We are forced to
capitulate to the struggle for bourgeois equality, and no further.
Second, it prevents us from asking the very important question of the
social basis for gender identity. All gender identity (cis and trans
alike) is a response to certain social conditions. Cis identity is a
lot less interesting, a process by which people accept the social
position they are socialized to inhabit. But the conditions that
could compel someone to reject this conditioning, now this is far
more interesting if we actually want to abolish the gender system! As
all Communists do.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">(7) The rise of identity and community
which resists cis-hetero-normativity, on some level, is reflective of
the obsolescence of the gender system. Whether we situate the social
origin of the gender system in the feudal mode of production (the
vestiges of which the women's movement has fought against), or in
more biological/reproductive functions (consider the rise and
accessibility of birth control, safer abortions, and other
technological advances which make controlling specifically women's
sexuality much less socially necessary or desirable), we are forced
to confront the fact of the gender system being somewhat antiquated.
It should not surprise us that the gender system is beginning to
crack.</p>
<p class="maintext-western"><br/>

</p>
<p class="maintext-western">(8) This creates new openings for
thinking about queer liberation and gender abolition. Some want to
turn queerness and gender abolition into a lifestyle struggle—gender
is a performance, and therefore we can abolish gender by refusing to
perform it. This has some compelling aspects, especially as we desire
to struggle against cis-het assimilationism. Some people struggle
against the condition of gender outlaw by fighting for &quot;acceptance&quot;
by &quot;respectable&quot; society. Our task as revolutionaries
should be, instead, to transform gender outlaws into gender rebels.
How can we weaponize our status against class enemies in a way that
targets class enemies? This is the task at hand.”</p>
