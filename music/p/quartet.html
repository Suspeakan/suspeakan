    <p style="text-align: justify;">Below are, as of 11/11/2023 (dmy), the four (quartet) best albums I've ever heard.</p>
    <p>There are four because all possible other albums had too many loose ends, these four have either none, very few, or they are not significant enough to keep it from being the GOATs. To give examples from each of the four: <i>Come In</i>, without the emotion (which is inseparable) it wouldn't be here, at least two of the tracks are usually skippable, but only one of those too are actually 'boring' ("Embarassing Paintings..."). <i>Close to The Edge</i> has only one low point, the later half of "Siberian Khatru", but it is by no means bad, just relatively not-as-good. <i>Enjoy Eternal Bliss</i>, and Yndi Halda in general, can be criticized in regards to the structure of all of the songs, build up — crescendo — calm down — build up — crescendo (usually ends at two, except for "Illuminate My Heart, My Darling!" which has three/four!), and that this is lazy or boring, I don't care! The point of bringing that up was to say that the 'low parts' as the songs build up to their (usually) second crescendo are the worst parts, especially in track three ("A Song For Starlit Beaches"), but none of these parts are bad, just less interesting and I often skip them to be closer to the breakout of the crescendo. <i>Tomodachi wo Koroshite Made</i> has only one relatively bad song, "Gakko Ni Ikitakunai", which I've just never liked.</p>
    <p>With all that being said, every other part of these albums are near, if not perfect.</p>

<br>

<p>These are in no particular order...!</p>

        </div>
    </div>
<p>This was my first exposure to Shinsei Kammatechan, other than "Boku no Sensou" ("My War"), and it's most similar to their first album, <i>Tsumanne</i>, but even then it's not—It is the pinacle of their sound, that "Internet Pop Rock" sound. From the awe and beauty of "Pentel", to head-splitting, intense, ballad of "Chiritori", this album is superb.</p>

    </div>
    <p>This was my the album/EP that got me into post-rock, even from the first listen this release blew my socks off, it is filled to the brim with emotional crescendos and movements that MUST be listened too with headphones in both ears, or else you are committing a grave, mortal sin.</p>
