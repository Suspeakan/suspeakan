        <p>"прон омпидэц поҗҳой-ко", as opposed to "прон поҗҳой-ко" or "омпидэц поҗҳой-ко". The third one is incomprehensible, the second one is grammatically unsound; the type of mistakes kindergarteners would make and then never make again. The first one is proper. Why? Nominalizing participles requires a modal particle, adverb or other kind of particle to encode its first instance, its lone nature. For example: "нэц демиделецҳой-ко", meaning "lesson/explaination". нэц is a particle which is very unique compared to almost all other СЫПЕҖ words, it most commonly encodes places and times. In this situation, the verb демиделец is being nominalized via nominal participalizion, нэц демиделецҳой-ко, <i>place explain/ing</i>. Sometimes, it's not so pretty or sensible, like the aforementioned "прон омпидэц поҗҳой-ко", what is "прон", meaning "platform", doing here? It is here to clear up the meaning of "омпидэц поҗҳой-ко", because other wise a word meaning "a in order to view" makes zero sense; as much sense as "прон поҗҳой", "viewing platform" (as in, the platform is doing the viewing, which is impossible), but adding a relevant noun to clear up the meaning so it makes sense, this isn't often done with actual verbs but nominalized ones. And "прон омпидэц поҗҳой-ко" means "balcony", a "platform for seeing/viewing".  </p>
        <p>
            An earlier stage of development of this language feature involved the participle suffix being -кё, instead of -ко, but only in this circumstance.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few more examples, "кхунэц омпидэц пулашказҳой-ко", meaning "office" or "studio", a room in a home that one works in. We again see this addition of clarifying nouns.
            <br><br>
            "кхунэц омпидэц ѳынецицмоҳой-кë ду кила" (very long word for laundry room)
            <br>
            "нэц нецицзопҳой" (a shorter word for laundry room)
            <br>
            <br>
            
        
        <p>    A major conflict of the language involves not making absurdly long nominalized participles but also not being super vague or ungrammatical.
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            One tactic to shorten words is to make them into spoken initialisms, like so: "нэц омпидэц пипаратҳой екумуникацё", into "енпепейе" (some initialisms are seemingly unintuitive). Or, using the laundry room example, "кхеѳекила", though "нэц нецицзопҳой" is a better term.
